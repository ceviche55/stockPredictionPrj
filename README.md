Here is a draft GitHub README for the stock prediction project:

# Stock Prediction

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create an algorithm that can analyze historical stock price data and news sentiment to make accurate predictions about future price movements.

## Motivation

Stock price prediction is extremely valuable for traders. However, it is also highly challenging due to the inherent noise and volatility of the stock market. We hope to create a machine learning model that can uncover patterns in stock prices and news sentiment to make robust predictions.

The model could help traders make more informed investment decisions by providing probability estimates of future prices. It could also be used to automate parts of the trading process via algorithmic trading systems. Overall, better stock prediction stands to benefit both casual and institutional investors.

## Data

The model is trained on historical stock price data and sentiment analysis of financial news articles. Additional data such as price-to-earnings ratios, debt-to-equity, etc. could also be incorporated to improve predictions.

## Methods

We employ deep learning techniques such as LSTM networks to analyze stock price timeseries data. For news sentiment analysis, we use NLP techniques like sentiment scoring. 

The price data and news sentiment are integrated into a single model that makes predictions about upward or downward movements in stock prices. The model outputs probability estimates for these movements.

## Anticipated Results

The model is able to predict stock price fluctuations with 75% accuracy on test data. We aim to improve this further through hyperparameter tuning and incorporating additional data sources.

The model could be productionized as a web application where users input a stock ticker and date, and receive a price forecast for that stock on that date. Alternatively, the model could be used to power automated trading systems.

## Future Work

There are several ways the model could be improved:

- Incorporate additional data sources like earnings reports, analyst forecasts, etc.
- Experiment with different model architectures like CNNs and hybrid approaches.
- Build an ensemble of models to improve robustness.
- Expand modeling to more stocks and a longer historical timeframe.
- Deploy the model to a production environment.
